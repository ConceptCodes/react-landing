# Landing - React.js + Tailwindcss
This is a [React.js](https://reactjs.org) web application powered by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) & [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com). The concept for the UI came from a post I saw on pinterest by [Dstudio Agency](https://www.instagram.com/dstudioagency/). I liked the minimalistic layout and decided to build it :)
